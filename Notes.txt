Setup before Presentation
VS
Open VS project
Expand Every project then collapse down to solution folders
Expand 1-Initial Code
Set SoftwareDoneProperly.Console as startup project
DB
Truncate Customers table
Open query to SELECT * FROM Customer
LinqPad
Open Linq Pad tabs in this order:
Prototyping
CreateCsvFile
CreateDatabase

Katas
EvenFibonacciNumbers
MinByTests
FizzBuzz

Taking problems out of context and then putting them back in context, makes them a lot easier to test. Think of Linq statements. I can now test with a simple list of integers instead of some complex object graph. (MaxBy, MinBy, SkipConditionally)



1-InitialCode - is the spaghetti code we need to refactor
ctor
1. Talk about the buried intent behind the action in the constructor
2. Talk about a quick possible refactoring

Main()
1. Talk about spaghetti code, and the fact that is has 179 lines of code
2. Walk through what it is trying to do, then summarize, mention mixing concerns
3. Show CustomersToImport.csv and blank db table
4. Make sure to mention that this code isn't testable
5. Mention that the first step to refactoring is isolation



2-FirstRefactor - move things to separate files (only isolation)
3-SecondRefactor - move separate files to new projects (code and NuGet isolation)
4-ThirdRefactor - actually improve the codebase
Move all the logic from the Console app and put it in the Domain layer, so that the console is only a pass through with composition

Mention that everything has it's place and once your used to the pattern you know exactly where things should go

3-SecondRefactor
SoftwareDoneProperly.SecondRefactor.Console
SoftwareDoneProperly.SecondRefactor.Final.Console
